## About this guide

This guide describes tools and strategies that help in troubleshooting
and debugging applications that use RabbitMQ in general and March Hare in
particular.

## What version of March Hare does this guide cover?

This guide covers March Hare 2.3 and later versions.


## First steps

Whenever something doesn't work, check the following things before
asking on the mailing list:

 * RabbitMQ log.
 * List of users in a particular vhost you are trying to connect.
 * Network connectivity, firewall settings, DNS host resolution.


## Inspecting RabbitMQ log file

In this section we will cover typical problems that can be tracked
down by reading RabbitMQ log.

RabbitMQ logs abrupt TCP connection failures, timeouts, protocol
version mismatches and so on. If you are running RabbitMQ, log
file location depends on the operating systems and installation method.
See [RabbitMQ installation guide](http://www.rabbitmq.com/install.html) for
more information.

### OS X with Homebrew

On Mac OS X, RabbitMQ installed via Homebrew logs to
`$HOMEBREW_HOME/var/log/rabbitmq/rabbit@$HOSTNAME.log`. For example, if
you have Homebrew installed at `/usr/local` and your hostname is `giove`,
the log will be at `/usr/local/var/log/rabbitmq/rabbit@giove.log`.



### Authentication Failures

Here is what authentication failure looks like in a RabbitMQ log:

```
=ERROR REPORT==== 12-Jul-2013::16:49:03 ===
closing AMQP connection <0.31567.1> (127.0.0.1:50458 -> 127.0.0.1:5672):
{handshake_error,starting,0,
                 {amqp_error,access_refused,
                             "PLAIN login refused: user 'pipeline_agent' - invalid credentials",
                             'connection.start_ok'}}
```

This means that the connection attempt with the username
`pipeline_agent` failed because the credentials were invalid. If you
are seeing this message, make sure username, password *and vhost* are
correct.

The following entry:

```
=ERROR REPORT==== 17-May-2011::17:26:28 ===
exception on TCP connection <0.4201.62> from 10.8.0.30:57990
{bad_header,<<65,77,81,80,0,0,9,1>>}
```

means that an old RabbitMQ version (pre-`2.0`) is used. Those versions
are not supported by March Hare 0.9+. It is recommended to use the
[latest stable release](http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html).

March Hare will raise `MarchHare::PossibleAuthenticationFailureError` in such
cases.


## Handling Channel-level Exceptions

A broad range of problems result in AMQP channel exceptions: an
indication by the broker that there was an issue that the application
needs to be aware of. Channel-level exceptions are typically not fatal
and can be recovered from. Some examples are:

 * Exchange is re-declared with attributes different from the original declaration. For example, a non-durable exchange is being re-declared as durable.
 * Queue is re-declared with attributes different from the original declaration. For example, an auto-deletable queue is being re-declared as non-auto-deletable.
 * Queue is bound to an exchange that does not exist.

and so on. These will result in a reasonably descriptive exception that subclasses `MarchHare::ChannelLevelException`.
Handling and logging them will likely reveal an issue when it arises.



## Testing Network Connection with RabbitMQ using Telnet

One simple way to check network connection between a particular network node and a RabbitMQ node is to use `telnet`:

```
telnet [host or ip] 5672
```

then enter any random string of text and hit Enter. RabbitMQ should immediately close down the connection. Here is an example session:

```
telnet localhost 5672
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
adjasd
AMQP    Connection closed by foreign host.
```

If Telnet exits after printing instead

```
telnet: connect to address [host or ip]: Connection refused
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host
```

then the connection between the machine that you are running Telnet
tests on and RabbitMQ fails. This can be due to many different
reasons, but it is a good idea to check these two things first:

 * Firewall configuration for port 5672 or 5671 (if TLS/SSL is used)
 * DNS resolution (if hostname is used)


## RabbitMQ Startup Issues

### Missing erlang-os-mon on Debian and Ubuntu

The following error on RabbitMQ startup on Debian or Ubuntu

```
ERROR: failed to load application os_mon: {"no such file or directory","os_mon.app"}
```

suggests that the *erlang-os-mon* package is not installed.


## asn1 Issue on Erlang R16B01

```
BOOT FAILED
===========

Error description:
    {error,{cannot_start_application,public_key,{not_started,asn1}}}
```

is an issue in RabbitMQ 3.1 on Erlang R16B01+. It is [resolved](http://rabbitmq.1065348.n5.nabble.com/Erlang-R16B01-and-SSL-td27526.html)
in RabbitMQ 3.1.2 and later versions.
